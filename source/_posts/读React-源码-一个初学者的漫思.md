# The React Source Code: a Beginner’s Walkthrough I

## 读React 源码:一个初学者的漫思

Ever been stuck in a video game? Do you remember reaching for that strategy guide while battling Shadow Link in the Water Temple? In the spirit of a video game walkthrough, this is a journey through the React Core source code so that beginners may achieve a deeper understanding of the tools they use. Many developers understand the what and how but missing the depth that conveys the why of React.

Furthermore, we write better code by reading good code. I know firsthand how intimidating the board-ranging scope of the React source can be. It is my hope that by building a line-by-line walkthrough of the React core source, its patterns and nuances will emerge to beginner developers. This knowledge should lead to a better understanding of the code developers write, encourage informated contributions to the community, and ultimately demystify open source projects.

I will try to make no assumptions about the reader, other than a familiarity with a JavaScript and experience with React. If there are any concepts that need further clarification, let me know and I will try to elaborate.
